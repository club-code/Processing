This doesn’t just apply in text as well (although one of the most popular applications is in your smart phone where there’s predictive text), it can be used for any scenario where you use historical information to define next steps for a given state. For example, you could codify a given stock market pattern (such as the % daily changes for the last 30 days), then use that to see historically what was the likely next day outcome (example only.. I’m very doubtful how effective it would be).
